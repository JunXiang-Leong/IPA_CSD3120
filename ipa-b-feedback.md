**OVERALL IPA-A + IPA-B Grade**: D+

**IPA-B Grade**: F
                                        
## B1
complete 3D scene (with (a) a background environment or live video feed and (b) manipulable objects) but no clear consistent theme
                                        
## B2
desktop-based grab and translate interaction exists and works well
                                        
## B3
attach interaction doesn't work
                                        
## B4
desktop-based rotate interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B5
"pinch" interaction doesn't work
                                        
## B6
desktop-based locomotion interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## Other feedback
Most of the required interactions are not working;
