# IPA-B Feedback for LEONG JUN XIANG
                                        
**OVERALL IPA-A + IPA-B Grade**: D+

**IPA-B Grade**: F
                                        
## B1
complete 3D scene (with (a) a background environment or live video feed and (b) manipulable objects) but no clear consistent theme
                                        
## B2
both desktop and an additional form of grab and translate interaction exist and works well
                                        
## B3
attach interaction doesn't work
                                        
## B4
desktop-based rotate interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## B5
"pinch" interaction doesn't work
                                        
## B6
desktop-based locomotion interaction exists but very buggy (or you only had additional, e.g. HMD, interaction but did not implement desktop-based)
                                        
## Other feedback
Based on some feedback on grading, this submission is reassessed to solve a bug making the player too far away to interact with the objects in VR.

After reloading the page a few times, the controller could bearly reach the objects when almost hitting the physical floor.

Most of the required interactions are still not working correctly:
No 'attach' interaction;
No 'pinch' interaction;
'rotate' and 'locomotion' interactions only work in VR mode.
